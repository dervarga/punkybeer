This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), but modified according to Heroku.
There is a Nodejs backend running on it.

It just renders the first 25 results from Punk API, the intention was to practice CSS and React a bit.

On mobile devices there might be some styling issues, especially with landscape orientation.

You can check it on Heroku: [punkybeer.herokuapp.com](punkybeer.herokuapp.com)
